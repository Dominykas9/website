<h1>OUTCOME 1</h1>

<h2>1.1 Describing the purpose of IT in modern business</h2>
<div>
<p>"Starting in the early 1980s with the first desktop computers, information technology has played an important part in the U.S. and global economies. Companies rely on IT for fast communications, data processing and market intelligence. IT plays an integral role in every industry, helping companies improve business processes, achieve cost efficiencies, drive revenue growth and maintain a competitive advantage in the marketplace."
<br>
</div>

<div>
<p>"Information technology fosters innovation in business. Innovation results in smarter apps, improved data storage, faster processing, and wider information distribution. Innovation makes businesses run more efficiently. And innovation increases value, enhances quality, and boosts productivity."</p>
</div>

<div>
    <p>In my own opinion the purpose is for storing: data, data bases, information, clients. Easy access to databases, check-in and check-out. It helps people to find the faster results who are using the electronics. So instead of having the habit not using the electronics.</p>
</div>

<h2> 1.2 Describing methods, tools, resources and skills needed to complete digital projects successfully - what do you need to make projects successful ?</h2>

<div>
    <p>I need the right resources, so I have a great idea on what I have to do at the end. At the start I have to have an idea of what I want to make and create, so I can achieve it the end of the project.

    For example let's take my digital project. My project is a website. I will need to use the SLACK and TRELLO websites, Visual Studio Code program. Python, HTML, CSS tools to make my digital project successful. I will have to use GITHUB pages to launch my site. Also duckduckgo.com (Internet Search Engine) and google as the resources. For any coding problem or anything like that. Slack for the assistance from my tutor/team leader. Trello is a tool that helps organise your projects. Trello is one of the most 
    popular applications used by developers for creating web sites. You create a troll board for each project, create lists to categorise the tasks, colour label these tasks and distribute these tasks to different members of your team.
    <br>
    I will also need to use social, effective communication and IT skills. Also independent and time-management skills because it's an individual project.</p>
</div>

<div>
    <h2>1.3 Plan and carry out tasks using IT - eg. making your website.</h2>


    <p>Today on 9-07-20 I have made my own website by using the assistance from my tutor, comunicating on slack website. Also using the program PYTHON. I' meant to finish this site by 17-07-20 and complete this digital project. 
        <br>
        From today Today (13-07-20)  I'm doing all the tasks from Unit 2, outcome 1 and uploading them on my website. So I will be doing all the units, outcomes for this project and upload them until I finish all of them. a</p>
    Here's the website for my personal Trello board <a href="https://trello.com/b/YZBVCLHc/web-develop">https://trello.com/b/YZBVCLHc/web-develop</a>
</div>

<h2>1.4 Describe the risks that might impact digital projects</h2>
<div>
<p>In my own understanding: One of the risks that might happen when a person doesn't know how to do their job right. This can impact the company and cost them a lot of finance. For example: if the person that leads the marketing team of the digital project doesn't know how to lead the marketing team. It could end up in a lot of money loss. As the people can be very inefficient. Another risk can be if the social marketing team becomes inefficient the company will not get as much recognition and can loose many clients. 
</div>

Another one is the mobile apps(applications). As it's not made correctly, people can breach the data. You have to have data base security in the app. This can costs a lot of finance, but knowing the right people can fix the issue. And make your app more secure. For example if you are making a game, you need to make sure it's safe and secure. So people can not hack it. The example for the game is: Town of Salem. In Dec 2018 a game made by "BlankMediaGame" has gotten a data breach and that has leaked to 7.6 million unique email usernames, passwords and purchase history. As a company that was in partnered with them, called "DeHased" tried to contact "BlackMediaGames" for many days. And has not got the response yet. It is an example of why the digital projects should be more secure and not exposed to sensitive details. Therefore there should be manual and auto-matic backups just for the security of other people.
    
</p>

<h2>1.5 Describe how you would go about selecting and using IT systems and software/– how do you select the right kind of technology for the job?</h2>

<p>I will begin this by using only my own knowledge. For computer systems, you would have to select the things you need exactly. This for sure is either a mouse and/or a keyboard, looking at what you need it exactly. It depends on the reason for what you will need it. Either work/home/gaming. For my personal use I always choose a mechanical keyboard and mouse. For example "Raser" it's great company for the gaming gear. As it's known for the mouse problems, I'd not recommend to get a mouse from them. For a mouse, I do prefer a "Logitech" company. By choosing my option cause you getting more software. Getting more software means overslowing your hard drive. Therefore if you get a "Raser" mouse, you will have only 1 software to deal with. Which is "Synapse". For work you could get a simple mouse and a keyboard which don't require a lot of energy. Buying the gaming gear would be very expensive, compared to the other types of gear. I always choose the gaming gear over anything else. 

<div>First of all: downloading software only by going to the official sites that has a certificate of the verification to know it's an actual company, that made the software. 3rd party websites can get you a lot of malware. This can cause the computer to run slower and inefficent. When that happens, you might need to reset the windows/Mac/OS in the computer. This might be very bad for the people who don't know how to do it, by themselves. So they would have to go to the computer shop to get it fixed. Paying about £40-100 pounds. Third parties websites can cause the computer to go bad. For example if you download a software that is by a 3rd party person. They can plant a bit coin miner inside the computer. This could be sneaky as the owner of the computer wouldn't know. Causing the hardware to damage such as the graphics card. Going to the computer shops is very unreliable. Due to the computer specialist could say that you have the problem in your computer whihc you don't to make more money out of you. (software) </div>

<h2>1.6 Describe and provide analysis on how your chosen technologies have helped you achieve your outcomes</h2>

<div>
    <p>I will begin this by using only my own knowledge. Starting with my PC and the internet, these 2 main technologies helped me to achieve all my outcomes so far. Without them I'd probably would not achieve them. Using windows 10 and Microsoft edge, Google Chrome helped me to use the right websites and download the right programs. 1 of them is the most important, called Visual Studio Code. Using it I complete all my outcomes. Also the assistance from my tutor/team leader in the slack website. </div>

<div>Specific technologies:
    Trello is a tool that helps organise my projects. Trello is one of the most popular applications used by developers for creating web sites. I create a troll board for each project, create lists to categorise the tasks, colour and label these tasks and distribute these tasks to different members of your team. [1]

<div>
    I am using html on the and Visual Studio Code program - Hyper Text Markup Language for coding the actual content of webpages.  
    It has been around since the early 90’s and continues to be a hugely important part of web development. HTML describes the structure of a webpage. It’s the most basic building blocks of the web. This is mandatory to create and finish the website project to complete course completely.

<h2>1.7 Describe legal guidelines and constraints that impact digital projects</h2>

<p>What is GDPR and why is it important?
    <br>
    GDPR will apply to all members of the EU and EEA from May 25, 2018. ... GDPR is important because it improves the protection of european data subjects' rights and clarifies what companies that process personal data must do to safeguard these rights.</p>

    <a href="https://www.visma.com/gdpr/why-is-gdpr-important/">https://www.visma.com/gdpr/why-is-gdpr-important/</a>"

<p> What does it mean to be GDPR compliant ?
    <br>
    GDPR is a regulation that requires businesses to protect the personal data and privacy of EU citizens for transactions that occur within EU member states. And non-compliance could cost companies dearly. Here's what every company that does business in Europe needs to know about GDPR. 29 May 2019</p>
