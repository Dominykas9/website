<h1>OUTCOME 3</h1>

<h2>3.1 Review the benefits and drawbacks of IT tools and systems used in terms of productivity and efficiency –  could you have been more efficient when making your website ? How ? Could you have done it in teams ?</h2>

<div><p>
Benefits
<br>
Regarding Visual Studio Code it has been really intuitive in order to correct some minor typing mistakes from time to time. 
Slack, Trello and VSC, Internet resources helped me to improve my efficiency and productivity. 
<br>
<br>
Drawbacks
<br>
I really can't find any drawbacks on the tools I used during the process. Some of the drawbacks I encountered were styling related. To learn and use the CSS in the code. Maybe sometimes I was struggling to answer the questions. 
<br>
</p></div>

<p>We could have done it in teams. Maybe I could have been more efficient when making my website in this way. I'm not sure because I have never done it before. In theory it might take less time to finish the project. Might have better style of the website. It depends on the skills and skill levels of the people within the team. What I experienced working in a team, it's harder to make decisions and choose decisions. I do prefer this project as an individual work for making faster decisions and putting them in practical way. </p>

<h2>3.2 Describe ways to improve productivity and efficiency</h2>

<div><p>Productivity is achieved by completing tasks in a short period of time and being efficient means finding the best ways of doing a particular task in relation to a given constrain. You can do that by: assigning your time to the most relevant tasks. 
<br>
Have and use time-management skills.
Investing time in yourself by continuously learning and keeping up-to-date. Learn new skills and improve your current ones. Google the code, update your code, update Trello board. Stay in touch with your Lecturer, ask for help if you need. 
<br>
<br>
In non-tech ways: taking breaks during the day and every day does help. Rest your tired eyes during the lunch breaks. Allow computer to rest also after every class. I was studying overtime sometimes. Doing yoga atleast once a week for 3 weeks. Exercising or sports, I always do play basketball atleast once a week to stay fit. Did make sure I wake up every morning to have enough time to get ready and have breakfast. Be punctual to all my classes, inform my Lecturer if something wrong happens. I have never missed a class intentionally, not to miss out on anything. Not to stay behind my collegues. Tried to have fun and enjoy every day coding. All these ways helped me improve my productivity and efficiency. They might help you too, definatelly give them a go. </p></div>

<h2>3.3 Develop solutions to improve own productivity using IT in digital projects – what would you do differently next time ? Team work ? Use of Slack ?</h2>

<div><p>Starting with the design and finishing with adding more asynchronous features. I probably would improve and use my styling skills for the next time. But in terms using the IT tools. I have found this amazing method, moving from one to another. Slack>Trello>VSC. Once I transferred all the required info from Slack, then I started every day from Trello>VSC->Google. Also Trello->Google->VSC. I'd never change this working style for the individual projects. 
<br>
A a team work it might be a bigger project. But more people than one is not always better. Team work requires a lot of making decisions, this might take the longest time of the project. This can be a disadvantage. 
<br>
<br>
How does slack improve productivity ?
<br>
"Be less busy." Slack's motto encourages users to increase their productivity through their real-time communication platform, and many teams find that it delivers on this message. As a messaging app designed with teams in mind, Slack has great features to keep your team members organized and in sync. Pose questions and answers, edit and update them. Set reminders, maybe use do not disturb me option/setting.

<h2>3.4 Describe how you would go about testing digital solutions</h2>

<p>Why I should test my web before launching and opening it ? How I should do it ? 
<br>
<div>To make sure it everything is fine with it and no errors on it. To find and correct all the mistakes. You should test your web using VSC. 
<br>The problem I encountered was with the names of the files in the code. For example all the files like UNIT1.1.HTML are supposed to be in lower case. So I had to rename all of my files and change the code too. So to fix that, I did rename all the codes, like a href="UNIT1.1.HTML">UNIT 1.1 to a href="unit1.1.html">UNIT 1.1 in every single file. This is a solution to fix this mistake in the code. Testing is very useful to see if all your design is working how you want it. The last check if you left any spelling, grammar mistakes. Images are fit and visible, maybe your audio is not working and you want to fix it. Might add extra answers to the questions.
