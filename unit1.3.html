<h1>OUTCOME 3</h1>

<h2>3.1 Review the benefits and drawbacks of IT tools and systems used in terms of productivity and efficiency –  could you have been more efficient when making your website ? How ? Could you have done it in teams ?</h2>

<div><p>
Benefits
<br>
Regarding Visual Studio Code it has been really intuitive in order to correct some minor typing mistakes from time to time. 
Slack, Trello and VSC, Internet resources helped me to improve my efficiency and productivity. 
<br>
<br>
Drawbacks
<br>
I really can't find any drawbacks on the tools I used during the process. Some of the drawbacks I encountered were styling related. To learn and use the CSS in the code. Maybe sometimes I was struggling to answer the questions. 
<br>
</p></div>

<p>We could have done it in teams. Maybe I could have been more efficient when making my website in this way. I'm not sure because I have never done it before. In theory it might take less time to finish the project. Might have better style of the website. It depends on the skills and skill levels of the people within the team. What I experienced working in a team, it's harder to make decisions and choose decisions. I do prefer this project as an individual work for making faster decisions and putting them in practical way. </p>

<h2>3.2 Describe ways to improve productivity and efficiency</h2>

<div><p>Productivity is achieved by completing tasks in a short period of time and being efficient means finding the best ways of doing a particular task in relation to a given constrain. You can do that by: assigning your time to the most relevant tasks. 
<br>
Have and use time-management skills.
Investing time in yourself by continuously learning and keeping up-to-date. Learn new skills and improve your current ones. Google the code, update your code, update Trello board. Stay in touch with your Lecturer, ask for help if you need. 
<br>
<br>
In non-tech ways: taking breaks during the day and every day does help. Rest your tired eyes during the lunch breaks. Allow computer to rest also after every class. I was studying overtime sometimes. Doing yoga atleast once a week for 3 weeks. Exercising or sports, I always do play basketball atleast once a week to stay fit. Did make sure I wake up every morning to have enough time to get ready and have breakfast. Be punctual to all my classes, inform my Lecturer if something wrong happens. I have never missed a class intentionally, not to miss out on anything. Not to stay behind my collegues. Tried to have fun and enjoy every day coding. All these ways helped me improve my productivity and efficiency. They might help you too, definatelly give them a go. </p></div>

<h2>3.3 Develop solutions to improve own productivity using IT in digital projects – what would you do differently next time ? Team work ? Use of Slack ?</h2>

<div><p>Starting with the design and finishing with adding more asynchronous features.
