<h1>OUTCOME 1</h1>

<h2>1.1 Describing the content and layout for each page</h2>

<p>The content contains all the mandatory tasks, questions and answers to complete this digital project. So I can pass this course. I have already made 3 pages. For example, content for the first page is the greeting, a short story about me and any relevant image to my story. Second page is made for Unit 1, outcome 1. Third page, Unit 2, outcome 1 and so on. The layout for each of this page probably starts always the same. The title of the page, the heading, body, paragraphs, style and the websites for the reference. Also sometimes I'm using the images to make it visually pleasing. 
</p>

<h2>1.2 Plan and create your website</h2>

<p>I have already created my website by using the Visual Studio Code program. It's not officially launched yet, but will be at the end of this digital project. I'm planning my website every day by editing it, uploading new content, styling it. So I'm using HTML and CSS tools to do that. Creating and changing the pages of the web. Creating and changing the layouts for each page. Pretty much updating it every day, to make sure I do complete all the outcomes. 
</p>

<h2>1.4 Selecting and using styles to keep your site consistent</h2>

<div><p>These are the example of which I use:
    <br>
    • Headings
    <br>
    • Paragraphs
    <br>
    • Links
    <br>
    • Lists
    <br>
    • and many more!
    <br>
    </div>

    HTML Elements
    <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element">https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element</a></p>

    <div>Buttons•Comments•Colors•Bullet points•Font=Style
    </div>

<div><p>I have selected and using the HTML (em) element. It marks text that has stress emphasis. The (em) element can be nested, with each level of nesting indicating a greater degree of emphasis. I really like to use the (br) element to break the lines between the sentences. Also comments and buttons can be used for the different styles. I'm not using the comments yet, but might use them later on. I'm trying to figure it out how to use the buttons in the right way. Don't forget to use the colors too ! At the moment I'm using the background, text and class colors to make the website to look much better. So people can see that I have spent extra time for styling. I love using the Bullet points as it's so easy to do that. Just copy and paste. Brings different kind of style to the web, so it's not always the same one.  I really hope all these types of styles are keeping my site consistent. </p>

<h2>1.5 Describing copyright and other constraints affecting websites</h2>

<div><p>"Copyright is the right of someone who creates an original image. As soon as an image is created it has copyright and the person who created it owns the rights to that image. Only the owner has the right to reproduce the  work, display the work in public and copy the work or sell copies of the work to other people.
<br>
There are trademarks too such as Coke and Pepsi that are protected by law from being used by other people or companies. 
<br>
The only exception to copyright is if you use an image from public domains such as Google Images. It is a difficult area because not everyone has given their permission for their photographs or artworks to be reproduced.
<br>
Fair Use is when you use an image for educational or news reporting purposes or if you have transformed the image or only used part of it.
<br>
It is always best to ask the owner of the image if you are not sure for their permission.
<br>
I think it is better to use your own photoraphs where possible because then you know they are your own property."</p>

<h2>1.7 Describe which are the appropriate filetypes for websites</h2>

<div><p> I have to research into the different filetypes for making websites and which ones I will need.</p></div>
    
<div>
    What are the most common file types used in websites ?
    <br>
    <br>
    AVI — Audio/Video Interleaved.
    <br>
    CSS — Cascading StyleSheet.
    <br>
    DOC — Microsoft Word DOCument.
    <br>
    EXE — EXEcutable file.
    <br>
    GIF — Graphics Interchange Format.
    <br>
    HTML/ . HTM — HyperText Markup Language file.
    <br>
    JPG/ . JPEG — Joint Photographic Experts Group file.
    <br>
    MIDI/ . MID — Musical Instrument Digital Interface.
    <br>
</div>
<p>So far I'm using the CSS of course to style the web. My style is really simple, but original. I can tell you it's a lot of work with it, so it's not easy to use it. But it's worth it, really helps to create the artistic look in the web. I might use the GIF and AVI later on but first I have to learn how to use them both. Also I will use any of these, if I will need to, as I'm willing to learn as much as possible to succeed. </p>

    Image File Formats - JPG, TIF, PNG, GIF Which to use ?  
    <br>
    JPG is the most used image file format. 
    <br>
    TIF is lossless (including LZW compression option), which is considered the highest quality format for commercial work.
    <br>
    <br>

    <br>
    <br>
    I think images have an important role in the website. To make it more presenting and make people enjoy the website too. What is the best image format for quality ? I'm using the JPG at the moment and it's working fine, I really suggest you using it. 
</p>

<h2>1.8 Storing and retrieving files effectively</h2>

<div><p>For example to store and retrieve files effectively on Visual Studio Code is very easy. For the images, just copy/cut and paste the image in the selected folder of the Visual Studio Code. Like I did create a new folder for the website and pasted my JPG image. So when I open my Visual Studio Code, open folder - website. I can see a JPG file - my image.
For the AVI — Audio/Video Interleaved I might need to store that also in my website folder of VSC.
</p>
</div>


<div><p>On SLACK:
    <br>
    You can choose a specific person or a channel, then find - attach a file. Add a file from either Google Drive or Your Computer to store the files effectively.
    Find and go to Files, on the top left corner. Select download and save it on your computer to retrieve it. You can also press share, share with other people personally or in the channel. So you store the file in your chats.
    Just drag a file to any chat and press enter to send it. 
    Press a Lightening Bolt button, called Shortcuts. Select create a code or snippet. Retrieving a code or snippet, just press on the file and either copy/cut+paste or download it. So what I do, check the activities, tasks. Then decide if either I need to store or retrieve it. To retrieve it copy/cut+paste them to my personal Trello board or to download a PDF file and store it in the Visual Studio Code folder. So I can retrieve the files whenever I want. Nothing complicated. 
</p>

<div><p>Using TRELLO, I don't store or retrieve any files technically, because I don't need that. Also I'm not sure if it's even possible. I keep the links for the info, reference for my outcomes to complete and show the location of the info. This also provides the the evidence.  
</div>
