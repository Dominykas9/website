<h1>Welcome to my website. I'm sure you are doing great ! </h1>

<p>Here I will show you how I carry out tasks using IT. EG: answering and presenting all the mandatory questions for my digital project.  Will do that in two ways: 1. How I understand and using my own knowledge. 2. Answering more in facts, using the resources and providing the references. Also tell you a little story about me. Hope you will enjoy the site.</p>

<h1>About myself</h1>

<p><em>Hello, my name is Dominykas Budukevicius, but you can call me Dominick or Dom. I'm 25 years old and originally from Lithuania. I came to London when I was 17 and started going to Newham college. Finished it in 2015 after 4 years of studying. My first official job was working in the hospitality industry. Started from a waiter/barman. Then got promoted to a supervisor role. Unfortunatelly had to leave the industry because of my health issues. Found another job as a delivery rider, then upgraded myself to a driver.  Was working before the Coronavirus started and then stopped when the quarantine started. It was my personal decision, to protect others and save lives. I did found out about the Code Nation course from my work coach and immediatly accepted the offer for free. 1 of the reasons is for the carreer change. Also for the better career in general. Wanted to challenge myself and see if I can pass this course. If I'm smart enough and to get another qulification in my life. Still being a gamer person really wanted to understand how technology is related to the gaming industry. How coding is related to the gaming too. Maybe find out how to create the games, even simple, logical ones. Using just text and images. It is a totally new experience and a different course for me. So all of these reasons made me be interested in joining Code Nation. I really hope to complete this course and to gain new skills too. </em></p>
