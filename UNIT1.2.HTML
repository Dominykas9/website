<h1>OUTCOME 2</h1>

<h2>2.1 Review the ongoing use of IT tools and change  approach as needed – in making your own  website, are you happy with the tools you used?  E.g. Visual Studio Code, Slack, Trello</h2>

<div><p>I'm really happy with the tools I've used. All the tools were provided by my tutor of the course from the Code Nation. It was my first time using them. It saved some of my time instead of myself searching for the IT tools. They are all connected to each other. Starting with Slack, then Trello and finishing the tasks on Visual Studio Code. So for example without the Slack I'd not know which tasks to do, so I couldn't continue on my work for this project. Moving from Slack to Trello as a 2nd location to keep on track with the 'Kanban' method. Things to do, doing and done really make sure I'm on the right track and working towards my goal. Which is to complete this project. Then using the same info I move it to the Visual Studio Code and start coding the website. Then opening my website on default browser to check it. I have to make sure I used the right coding which I wanted to use. Checking if the code works properly. I can't find about other IT tools I'd use instead of these. Maybe for the extra tools I'd use Google Drive, Google Slides. 
</p></div>

<h2>2.2 Describe whether the IT tools selected were appropriate  E.g. Visual Studio Code, Slack, Trello</h2>
<div><p>For this kind of individual project, the IT tools selected were definatelly appropriate. I can't think of anything else more appropriate than these IT tools. Unless it would be a team project then, Zoom website would be a very appropriate tool. For the meetings and chatting, sharing info/files. Or maybe a Skype program to communicate 24/7 with your team. Skype provide free and unlimited calls, so can talk with your team all day, every day. Which makes the work much easier. Trello is appropriate for the team work too. Creating a team board and providing the access for everybody. So your team can access and edit it anytime. Really accessible. Also team can divide members to be resposible for the specific tasks. 1 person can work on Slack, other one on Trello and the last on Visual Studio Code. So all team is working with different tools at the same time. It might be very efficient. Maybe more efficient than an individual.

<h2>2.3 Assess the strengths and weaknesses of your final project – are you happy with your website ?  Why ? Why not ? You should review it on the website itself in the interests of openness. What would you change ?</h2>

The general strenghts of my final project are quickly fixing my coding errors. Was trying to answer as many questions as possible, without anybody's help. Being honest and using my own opinion to answer some questions. Always referencing the links of the source. Making fast decisions. Was always trying to use something new, what I have learned in my website. To make it different, better, more interesting, enjoyable. Fast learning how to use and using new IT tools. Studying overtime. Time-management skills. IT, social and effective communication skills. Researching the sources for the facts and using them. 
<br>

<div><p>I think the strenghts of the website are:
    <br>
    1. Well Planned Information Architecture
    <br>
    2. Well-Formatted Content That Is Easy to Scan
    <br>
    3. Browser Consistency
    <br>
    4. Effective Navigation
    <br>
    5. Original style
    <br>
    6. Formatting text
</p></div>

The general weaknesses of my final project are short period of time to complete it. Not enough training with the tutor. Too many questions to answer and took long time to do it. 
<div><p>In my opinion weaknesses of my website are:
    <br>
    1. Mobile Compatibility
    <br>
    2. Accessible to All Users
    <br>
    3. Too simple
    <br>
    4. Not enough images  
    <br>
    5. An oldschool style/not modern
    <br>
</div></p>

I'm happy with my website, according to my experience and knowledge in coding. As I have none of the qualifications related to this. As I know I could upgrade it if I had more time. Or if I had less questions. So I could only be focused on styling the site. I'd try to get rid of all my weaknesses of this project and have more strenghts. That's what I would change or try to change in my project. I wish to test this project with a team and check the differences. 

<h2>2.4 Describe further improvements you can make to your project</h2>

• Improve the style of the website.
• Use more different files.
• Implement more features.
• Elicit google analysis code to track visits to my site to be able to ascertain where my visitors are from.
• Implement a simple web-form so people can ask me questions and I will get back to them if they want to know more about me.
• Implement asynchronous feature in the site. Like different sections displaying different information from different aspects of my portfolio.
• Use AVI — Audio/Video Interleaved.
• GIF — Graphics Interchange Format. 

<h2>2.5 Review outcomes to make sure they match requirements and are fit for purpose</h2>

<p>To complete the tasks I was allowed to use the internet resources. So this helped me a lot for the questions to answer which I had no idea how to answer. 
<br>
<br>
Preparing appropriate content for my site, I have included the essential content, wrote a compelling web copy and used the right language.
<br>
<br>
Organise and combine information needed for webpages including different platforms:
<br>
Gathered and moved info from one to another: Slack->Trello->Internet resources/my own brain->VSC. Started and finished to combine the info always in VSC and finally organising it in there. This is my kind of 'Kanban' method. I also did some organising on Trello as to have a first draft copy of my site. Organising is fun on Trello. My Lecturer was able to check my work there. 
<br>
<br>
Select and using appropriate editing and formatting techniques for clarity and good navigation
<br>
I have selected font style 'Fondamento' for my heading 1 which is only in my index (home page). Font style 'Roboto' for each heading 2 (question/task). Heading 1 is the biggest size for the heading and 2 is the second biggest size. These formatting techniques are fit for the clarity of a page purpose. 
<br>
<br>
For good navigation I'm using kind of buttons on the top of every page in the website. They work like buttons but they are actually not buttons. They divide the pages on the web. For example Home and Unit 1.1, Unit 2.1 and Unit 1.2.
